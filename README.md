# Password-Generator
Homework 3 for Coding BootCamp

The task was to develop a password generator using javascript that returned passwords with Upper case, lower case, symbols and numbers.

Prompts were to be provided to ask what sort of characters the user wants in their password and how long they want their password to be. The html and CSS files were provided.

I began by pseudo coding to try and work out the best way to tackle the homework.

i went through many different ways of trying to get a result and read/watched some different resources. To be honest, I felt some of this lead me down the wrong path and resulted in a lot of wasted time and a lot of code written that was ultimately discarded.

I created a prompt asking the user how long they wish their password to be.
Depending on their input resulted on an if/else statement with further prompts regarding the type of password they wish to have.

I am unsure if this method of prompts is the best way to do it as i found it tricky to then use this information later.

A code was then (finally) created which created a password using the user inputs which showed on the user screen in the box. this code is only returning a value in lower case however as I was unable to work out a way to user the different variables.

A random password is ultimately generated, however the output is only in lower case.
